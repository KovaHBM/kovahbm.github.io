  abstract = {The present work investigates the influence of uncertain tooth profile modifications on the nonlinear dynamic response of a spur gear pair induced by a backlash nonlinearity. To this end, an original approach based on bifurcation tracking is developed. The equations of motion are solved in the frequency domain with the harmonic balance method (HBM) coupled to an arc-length continuation algorithm and a bordering technique. The evolution of the bifurcation points with respect to the uncertain parameter is computed in a deterministic way. The study focuses on minimizing the amplitude-jump instabilities induced by the backlash nonlinearity around the primary resonance peak. The proposed methodology allows for a fast and reliable estimation of the tooth profile modification that minimizes the amplitude-jump instability by defining two criteria using the results of the bifurcation tracking algorithm. Probability density functions (PDF) of various indicators of the severity of vibro-impacts can be computed with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation with minimal computational burden. Results show that the tooth profile modification that minimizes the amplitude-jump instabilities differs from the optimum obtained with static computations. },

  TITLE = {{Vibro-impact dynamics of large-scale geared systems}},
  AUTHOR = {M{\'e}lot, A. and Perret-Liaudet, J. and Rigaud, E.},
  abstract = {This work is concerned with the analysis of vibro-impact responses observed in large-scale nonlinear geared systems. Emphasis is laid on the interactions between the high frequency internal excitation generated by the meshing process, i.e. the static transmission error (STE) and time-varying mesh stiffness (TVMS), and low frequency external excitations. To this end, a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of a pump equipped with a reverse spur gear pair (gear ratio $1\kern-.25em :\kern-.25em 1$) is built. The model takes into account the flexibility of the kinematic chain, the bearings and the housing and the gear backlash nonlinearity. A reduced-order model is solved with the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) coupled to an arc-length continuation algorithm which allows one to compute the periodic solutions of the system. The onset and disappearance of vibro-impact responses is studied through the computation of grazing bifurcations. Results show that the coupling between the external excitation and the time-varying mesh stiffness term greatly modify the characteristics of the responses in terms of number and periodicity of impacts and contact loss duration.},

The approach is based on a complex formulation of the well-known harmonic balance method (HBM). Hill’s method is used to assess the stability of the computed forced response curves, and a minimally extended system is built to allow for the parametric continuation of the detected bifurcation points. The feasibility of coupling HBM-based minimally extended systems and arc-length continuation algorithms is established and demonstrated. The method offers an efficient way of determining the stability regions of the system. The methodology is applied on a spur gear pair model including the backlash nonlinearity and subjected to transmission error and mesh stiffness fluctuation whose harmonic contents depend on several parameters that do not appear explicitly in the equations of motion.},

abstract = {Weight reduction is a recurring concern in the design of modern mechanical systems. This search may lead engineers to resort to using gears with holes in order to meet their requirements. This paper presents a methodology to carry out nonlinear dynamic analyses of a gear transmission with holes in the gear blanks subjected to a multiharmonic internal excitation. This work investigates the influence of these holes on the vibration levels, occurrence of contact loss and possible bifurcations. The numerical model features two flexible shafts coupled by a spur gear pair with holes. The gear model consists in two lumped masses and inertias and includes the gear backlash as well as the internal excitation sources that are the time-varying stiffness and the static transmission error (STE). The resulting mechanical system is solved in the frequency domain by the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) coupled with an arc-length continuation algorithm and its stability is evaluated with Hill’s method. Results show that adding holes not only impacts the STE but also the mesh stiffness. The interactions of these two quantities has a substantial influence on the bifurcation structure along the main solution branch and leads to a decrease of the span of vibro-impact regions. As the applied static torque is increased, it is found that using holed gear blanks can effectively prevent contact loss and lead to a linear response.},

abstract = {The prediction of noise and vibrations generated by geared systems remains a challenging field of study. The analysis of such systems is computationally demanding mainly due to the large size of the finite element model used to describe the system and the nonlinear behaviour arising from the contact between the gear teeth. As a consequence, very few models have been proposed to handle lightweight gears which are widespread in current industrial designs. Lightweight gears lead to a strong modification of the gear compliance, and therefore the contact force distribution. The static transmission error and the mesh stiffness fluctuations are thus influenced by these changes. In this paper, a 2D decomposition method is proposed to compute the static transmission error of gears with holes in the gear blanks without heavy computational effort. The original methodology relies on the substructuring of the holed gear blank from the gear teeth. It is applied on several spur gear systems with holed gear blanks and compared with a fully flexible multibody method. The validity of the approach is assessed in terms of static transmission error and mesh stiffness fluctuations. Moreover a parametric study is carried out using the 2D decomposition method in order to analyse the influence of holes regarding their position and number.}

abstract = {A smartphone is a low-cost pocket wireless multichannel multiphysical data acquisition system: the use of such a device for noise and vibration analysis is a challenging task. To what extent is it possible to carry out relevant analysis from it? The Survishno conference, held in Lyon in July 2019, proposed a contest to participants based on this subject. Two challenges were proposed, wherein each a mute video showing an object moving/excited at different frequencies was provided. Due to the frequencies set and the video sampling characteristics, special effects occurred and are visible on both videos. From the first video, participants were asked to estimate the Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) of a rotating fan. From the second video, they were asked to perform the modal analysis of a cantilever beam. This paper gathers the interesting ideas proposed by the contestants and proposes a global method to solve these two problems. One major point of the paper might be the advantageous use of the rolling shutter effect, a well-known artefact of smartphone videos, to perform advanced mechanical analyses: the consideration of the unavoidable slight phase shift between the acquisition of each pixel opens up the possibility to perform a dynamic analysis at frequencies that are much higher than the video frame rate.}
