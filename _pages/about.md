I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, France. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering from ISAE-Supméca, Paris, France, in 2018. In 2016-2017 I was a visiting student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London, UK. During my stay, I worked on the project Modal Analysis of Rotating Structures with Digital Image Correlation. I also hold a MSc in Modelling and Simulation in Structural Mechanics and Coupled System from CentraleSupélec.
