I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (Inria) in the [Statistical Inference for Structural Health Monitoring](https://team.inria.fr/i4s/) (I4S) research team. I currently work on the [NO-BIF](https://www.inria.fr/en/no-bif) project.

I graduated in Mechanical Engineering from ISAE-Supméca, Paris, France, in 2018. In 2016-2017 I was a visiting student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London, UK. During my stay, I worked on the project Modal Analysis of Rotating Structures with Digital Image Correlation. I also hold a MSc in Modelling and Simulation in Structural Mechanics and Coupled System from CentraleSupélec.
